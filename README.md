# Build-and-Test-Code-with-Jenkins-then-Manually-Deploy-Your-Application-to-Elastic-Beanstalk

## In this Deployment, we are going to build our own Jenkins pipeline to build and test our application code and then manually deploy it to Elastic Beanstalk. To do this, we'll be using Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance, to serve as our virtual machine. Once our instance is created, we'll install Jenkins and all the dependencies required to run our code. Once our code sucessfully runs, we'll navigate to Elastic Beanstalk to deploy our application. In order to complete this, we'll need the following:
-  AWS Account
-  AWS CLI
-  Jenkins
-  GitHub
-  Jenkins

# Linux

## Set Up Your Virtual Environment:

In order to complete this project, it is necessary to set up a virtual environment. In order to achieve this, first, create a free [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) and then create a virtual server using the Ubuntu Server OS.
